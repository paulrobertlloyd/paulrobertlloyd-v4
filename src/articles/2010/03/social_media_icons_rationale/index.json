Thank you for putting this out there, I really appreciate it.\n\nI wonder if MeetUp and/or SoundCloud might meet your criteria for inclusion now? I’m also a libre.fm user, but I’m aware that there are not too many of us.\n\nAnyway, thanks again!"

Nice set overall, I was about to start my own if  google hadn’t led me here :)"
