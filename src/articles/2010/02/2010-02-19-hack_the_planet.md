Just a quick reminder that our [Hack The Planet][1] event takes place tomorrow, starting at 10am sharp. We’ll be wonderfully accommodated by [One Black Bear][2] at their offices at The Old School House, 191 Fazeley Street, Birmingham. It’s open to everyone and free to attend—all you need to bring is your ideas and a laptop!

Gareth at One Black Bear has provided the following information:

> The main blue doors will be open on Saturday morning from 9:30am to 11:00am, and we have use of the main reception (including cups of tea) until 11am.
>
> To enter our office, head for the big blue doors on Fazeley Street (blue push pin), this will take you to the main reception. If you are looking for the back entrance, there is a black door on Floodgate St (red push pin).

If you need directions be sure to check out the [One Black Bear Studio and Parking Map][3] for more details.

Food and drink will be provided, and once again we thank [Campaign Monitor][4] for their continued support of [Multipack][5] events.

## Press coverage

You may have seen some press coverage over the last week. Simon Whitehouse [wrote about the event][6] on the Digital Birmingham blog, and Anna Blackaby kindly [wrote about us in the Birmingham Post][7]. Meanwhile, Multipack member and Geek in the Park organiser Trevor Morris has been [blogging about the event][8] as has [Matt Machell][9]. A big thank-you to everyone who has helped spread the word, and many others behind the scenes who have helped get this show on the road!

If you are planning on attending, please let us know by signing up at our [event detail page on Upcoming][1]. We look forward to seeing you there!
