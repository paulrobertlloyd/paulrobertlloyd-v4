    "content": "Hi Mike,\n\nObviously I would like to rebut your claims of these icons as being direct rip-offs of those icons by Rogie King.\n\nI note that on Twitter [you have apologised](http://twitter.com/mike9r/status/2740676784), and stated that you believe I had mistakenly linked to Rogie’s icons, but had since changed the link. I’m slightly confused by this claim as this is just not true. This download link has not changed since I published this post. My guess is that you saw the 16x16 icons previewed above, and without downloading the file and inspecting it’s contents, left a comment here (and more damagingly) made the same claims on Twitter (resulting in the predictable thoughtless re-tweeting by others).\n\nBut in the spirit of full disclosure, I am happy to provide a little more background on how these icons came into being.\n\nIn the past I had found that the only suitable 16x16 icons available for linking to different social networks were the favicons used by the respective websites, yet these were often visually inconsistent and in some cases, rather ugly.\n\nAfter doing some similar icons for a client in April, I decided that I would rectify this and spend some time creating a set of icons for my favourite social networks, with my two key goals being that they didn’t stray too far from the original favicons (YouTube excluded – I absolutely hate their favicon!) and that they all had a consistent appearance.\n\nAt this time I had seen [Rogie’s initial set of icons](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2008/12/social-media-mini-iconpack/) (as noted in the above post) and also the gorgeous icons created by [Tim Van Damme](http://timvandamme.com/) for use on his address card site, whose icons inspired me to create the larger icon sizes. I completed most of these during the May Bank Holiday, but being a perfectionist (and susceptible to chronic bouts of procrastination) I never finished the entire set.\n\nHowever two things spurred me on to bite the bullet and finish my icons. Firstly a discussion with my colleagues in the pub about not worrying too much about trying to achieve perfection (i.e. ‘Great Artists Ship’) and secondly seeing that Rogie had released his updated set of icons.\n\nThis was of course my worse fear. When I created my icons nobody had done a set of popular social network icons in sizes greater than 16x16, but I knew it was only a matter of time before somebody would, and Rogie did (and they are [a fantastic set of icons](http://www.komodomedia.com/blog/2009/06/social-network-icon-pack/)).\n\nRogie is obviously a far more talented illustrator than I am, and I love that each of his icons reflect his own unique style. Yet at the same time this is precisely why I wanted to create my own icons – I wanted icons with a more generic feel, simply customised so that they felt like they belonged to the same family.\n\nNow these icons may not be *that* different to Rogie’s, but how could they be? After all both sets of icons are built upon the same foundations – that of the logos and colours of the respective social networking services. However each and every pixel of these icons has been crafted by my own fair hands, and many hours have been spent working on them.\n\nI apologise for the lengthy reply, but it may not surprise you that I’m a little annoyed by your comments, both here and on Twitter (with its [rather flimsy retraction](http://twitter.com/mike9r/status/2740676784)). If you don’t like my icons, then of course that’s your own personal opinion, but please don’t insult me by claiming I am some sort of rip-off artist. I find such comments unhelpful."

Initially your ZIP file was 0 bytes and I thought something odd was going on, my only explanation is that your ZIP was named exactly the same as Rogie’s and I had his in the same folder. After I deleted all ZIPs in my Downloads folder I gave it another shot and finally saw your actual icons which are very, very nice.\n\nYou have my sincerest apologies and immediately after I discovered my mistake I deleted the tweets that contained my remarks and apologized. As Rogie has mentioned I would not do something like this maliciously, it was a mistake on my part, and I’m very sorry."

Apology excepted.\n\nI guess the thing that annoyed me most about this whole episode was clicking on ‘Mentions’ in Tweetie, to see tens of re-tweets of your original status update, which in effect magnified the intensity of your original claim.\n\nAnyway, the subject of retweeting merits an entirely different blog post devoted to it (and another thing I’ve delayed doing). I guess I should get it written up before Rogie beats me to it ;-)"

Nor do I anticipate updating the YouTube icon to match the current favicon, because frankly, it’s ugly.\nI am thinking about ways in which I can provide a template file with this package though, which would allow you to create your own icons in a similar style. If you have suggestions as to which format(s) this should be  available in, please let me know!\n\nThanks for your support,\nPaul"

Just a suggestion, of course.\n\nSpeaking of which: as I assume we all prefer using your icons instead of text links (that’s why we’re here, after all!), may I also suggest that you add an icon to your own website, so that we may link back to you with style? ;)\n\nThank you again and best regards."
