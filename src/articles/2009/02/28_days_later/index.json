    "content": "At ZURB, we “help” each other to keep up on the blogging. Almost all of us blog in some capacity – it’s a nice way to keep everyone up on their written and communication skills, as well as learn from and educate others.\n\nThe biggest encouragement we have though comes from competition. We run a little contest in the office: The ZURBlog Cup Race. It’s been going strong for 8 months now. Every 3 months, we reset, as if it were another race. Points are awarded for each entry, comment, and view (on a scale). It’s lots of fun :D.\n\nMy point? Maybe a rewards system is in order for you :)"
