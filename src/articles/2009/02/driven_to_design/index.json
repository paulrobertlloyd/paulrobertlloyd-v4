    "content": "I think what got me into it is my urge to not just be better myself, but make everything around me better. I call myself an interaction designer these days, but grew up thinking about being a Web or graphic designer. I’ve found interaction designer to be much more appropriate in that I love it when I just hit if off with a website, product, or service.\n\nInteracting with things can be so easy, so enjoyable – or it can be a downright nightmare. It’s my passion to make (design) and use things that put a smile on my face every time I use them.\n\n(Also, as a little background, I grew up building PCs before creating themes and icons for Windows XP. That eventually led me to Photoshop and GeoCities… the rest is history)."
