Then multiply that by the amount of venues in the world. I’d say that compared to things like the boat show SXSW isn’t, by far, the worst.\n\nBut trying to stop this is like trying to stop a force of nature. Advertisers will have their way. I look forward to hearing what action we as a community can take to stop this damaging practice."
