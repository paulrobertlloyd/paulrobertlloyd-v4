October has been a crazy month, and I’m not even done with it yet!

It started with a bizarrely warm weekend that almost fooled me into believing I’d travelled back in time to July. After an evening of fine food and natter with the Roobottom’s, I spent much of the Saturday on Littlehampton beach doing what one does on such a day; namely eating a 99 and gorging on Fish and Chips from [West Beach Cafe][1] (sadly not as tasty as those from nearby Fred’s).

On Sunday I ventured up to London to catch the [Kenneth Grange exhibition][2] at the Design Museum. To think that many of the products we take for granted were designed by one man is pretty astounding. A leisurely stroll followed, which gave me a chance to observe a city drowned in a beautiful sunset.

The entire weekend felt like a second chance at summer; I think I made the most of it.

Last Tuesday I joined [Adam Perfect][3] for the filming of <cite>[Mock The Week][4]</cite> at BBC Television Centre. I’ve always wanted to see the recording of a television show, and found the process immensely fascinating. I expected a degree of editing, but I was amazed by the amount of footage (2 hours) required for a programme that’s only 25 minutes long.

I returned to Shepherd’s Bush on Monday, this time see [Demetri Martin][5] with [Jon][6]. I’ve been a huge fan of Demetri since watching [his trendspotting spot][7] on <cite>The Daily Show</cite> in 2006, and seeing him live meant I could cross another item off my bucket list. This was a relaxed and informal performance where the audience was encouraged to participate. I felt privileged to see this show, especially as was one of only three he performed in the UK this time round.

My brother and his young family have also been visiting too. I gave them a quick tour of Brighton on Saturday, and on Sunday we headed to Carshalton to visit one of my Aunts. Holding the important role of uncle meant playing on the swings, roundabouts and slides — I’m not sure who had more fun!

Today I head to Washington DC, the first stop on a packed itinerary that starts with [An Event Apart][8], covers a number of cities in Canada and finishes up with Dan and Liz’s wedding in San Francisco. Hopefully I’ll have a chance to reflect on the trip when I get back.
