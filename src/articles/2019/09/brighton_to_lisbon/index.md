**05:30, Brighton.** I arrive at Brighton station as the last few stragglers from Saturday evening noisily leave. Having developed a horrid cold, I suspect this drawn-out journey will be less enjoyable than I had hoped.

**07:18, London Victoria.** Wait 15 minutes for a Victoria line train to arrive, a feat of endurance given the oft-repeated announcement about escalator repairs.

**08:19, London St. Pancras.** Board the Eurostar. A rare chance to travel on one of the (not-so-new) [e320][1]s.

**10:48, Paris-Nord.** [Gare du Nord][2] seems to get more beautiful with every visit. I have an hour to dash south to my next connection via the *RER*{lang="fr"} to *Port-Royal*. The ticket machine seems designed to test the patience of users, remaining unresponsive for just over a minute before serving the next customer. How French!

**12:34, Paris-Montparnasse.** After a brisk walk from the *Port-Royal* RER station, I arrive at this [modern carbuncle][3] with about 10 minutes to spare. The French railway system is now a mishmash of different brands, so I board an *SNCF TGV INOUI*{lang="fr"} service to Hendaye. The [double-decker Duplex][4]’s are incredibly spacious. My reclining seat has a large pulldown table, desk light, USB and power sockets. All undone by a low-hung luggage rack which I repeatedly hit my head against.

**18:35, Hendaye.** Having arrived 45 minutes earlier, I board the [_Sud Express_][5], a *Renfe*{lang="es"}/*CP*{lang="pt"} operated train hotel that has seen better days. In one of the carriages is a small bar/restaurant, lorded over by portly gentleman fond of rules. No photos. No video. No card payments. I inadvertently break the first rule before seeing the sign. The third rule is not apparent until I try to pay for my meal. I have visions of doing the washing up as payment. Fortunately, the train manager is able to bring a card payment machine to my compartment later in the evening.

**07:55, Lisbon Oriente.** Arrive after a rough night with little sleep. My throat is sore, my nose stuffed up, and my ears have endured a night of rattling doors, squealing rails and the wheezing plumbing of an adjacent toilet. Sections of the route were so bumpy derailment seemed a distinct possibility. I briefly explore [another of Santiago Calatrava’s extravagant railway stations][6], before making my last connection via the Lisbon Metro.

**09:00, Saldanha.** Seven trains, four countries and 27 and half hours later, I arrive at my hotel, where I’m able to check-in early and have a shower. I do it all over again, but in reverse, in a week’s time.
