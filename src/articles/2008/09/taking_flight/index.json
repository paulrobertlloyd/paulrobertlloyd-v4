I think there is a chance that I will be around there too (I will be visiting the us from 8 to 31 of october!)\n\nbtw, nice blog. one small suggestion though: reading text on the left side of my maximized firefox screen is a little annoying, please consider some centralized column or a bigger margin :)"

It was multicoloured originally, and I may still alter the colouring in the future.\n\nThanks for the comments all!"

I take it the header “…and is currently located somewhere near…” takes it’s data from the last post you wrote? Or maybe you use your iPhone to send it GPS data? Either way, nice work.\n\nAs for the overall design – I generally love it, not convinced about the line drawing of the world in the background – but again that could grow on me.\n\nGood work! Finally you have somewhere to blog!"
