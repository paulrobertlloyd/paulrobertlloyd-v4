This year has been tough. I almost expected as much. Lockdowns and global pandemics were such unfamiliar territory in 2020 that their novelty more than made up for the isolation and loneliness they bestowed. [I flourished][1]! This year? Not so much. Iâ€™m done with all the uncertainty, as well as the continued parade of government corruption, incompetence and indifference.

2021 has so far fallen fantastically short of its promise. It began with yet another lockdown, one survived only by sustaining illusions of my own making. As lockdown restrictions lift, I now feel detached and despondent. I am so desperately sad, stuck in the past and unable to move forward.

I still believe that good things may come, but my faith is being sorely tested.
