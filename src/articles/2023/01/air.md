Some exciting news; I’m back in government! After a 6 month break (and with [the first version of Indiekit released in beta][1]) I’ve started a new contract with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Those who know me will know that I’ve long been a champion of looking after our planet and #DoingMyBit. While I enjoyed digging into the complexities of teacher training, and learning all about social housing, I’m really excited to be immersing myself in a policy area closer to my interests: air quality.
