A huge fan of [<cite>The Colbert Report</cite>][1], although living in the UK meant I was unable to watch full episodes, I could often be found howling with laughter as I gorged on the available clips on YouTube. Yet watching [video shorts][2] released prior to Colbert’s debut as new host of <cite>The Late Show</cite>, I sensed a change in comedic direction, and wondered whether the transition to a more mainstream slot would be a painful, and ultimately unsuccessful endeavour.

Now, having watched clips from his first week sat behind the desk inside a renovated [Ed Sullivan Theater][3], I’m left wondering why I had any doubts. While the new show sticks to the traditional American late-night format, enough elements of his previous show remain, and the humour remains familiar. [Writing about the first show][4], Megan Garber noticed another important similarity:

> [<cite>The Colbert Report</cite>] was notable not just for its satire, but for its intellectualism: It introduced its audience to authors and thinkers who might not get an airing on typical late-night, or for that matter typical news, shows. <cite>The Late Show</cite>’s debut suggested that Colbert might carry on that tradition, expanding it to a wider audience. It suggested a proposition that, until last night, seemed as absurd as it is simple: that late-night comedy, aired on a large network, can be funny and smart at the same time.

On any other show, an interview with Uber’s CEO [Travis Kalanick][5] would have been fawning and over congratulatory, but Colbert’s questions didn’t avoid the controversies surrounding this company. It also revealed Kalanick’s rather hollow and evasive personality:

With Colbert no longer playing the character of a “[well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot][6]”, and with the exaggerated conceit of political punditry stripped away, it appears we may still get the same satire and humour, but with a more open, honest and [warmer][7] host. I think it works.

Which begs the question: when can we expect episodes to be broadcast in the UK?
