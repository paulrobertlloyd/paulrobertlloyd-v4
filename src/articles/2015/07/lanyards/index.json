    "content": "I certainly like the idea of collecting lanyards at the end. Something we should definitely do at Clearleft’s conferences, especially as the lanyards are usually branded ‘Clearleft’ (although sponsorship is available :-)\n\nAs for name badges, I think they enhance the experience, at least if they are designed so that you can read people’s names without getting accidentally intimate. I like to remember who I’m talking to – I don’t have the best memory when it comes to matching names to faces."
