Disorientating at first, I love that <cite>[Sex Education][1]</cite> has an opinion about where it is set. *Moredale* seems to be a colourful mid-Atlantic backwater, one where fashion was paused around 1985. It’s also a place where some technologies appear to face slower adoption than others — the internet, laptops and smartphones exist, but Ford Cortinas and cathode-ray tubes are still in wide use as well. I want to live in that kinda world.

It all amounts to a boy-meets-girl comedy that has echos of <cite>[Skins][2]</cite>, but whose edginess and progressive values are wrapped up in a comfort blanket of nostalgia. Anyway, I can’t wait for series 3 — although not yet confirmed, it’s surely on the cards.
