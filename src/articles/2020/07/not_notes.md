summary: 10 random things I avoided saying over the last six months.
---
This website is a place where I can share [short thoughts][1], but as they also appear in other places (as ‘[tweets][2]’, ‘[toots][3]’ or ‘[microblogs][4]’), I often decide it’s probably best to keep some of these to myself.

That said, I do keep hold of them, and its fun to look at them out of context, long after the events that triggered them.

If only so that I can delete the page in my notes app where I’ve been saving them, here are 10 random things I avoided saying over the last six months:

* The suggestion that “Google wants the web to win” is laughable. Google wants Google to win. It would throw the web under the bus in a heartbeat, if doing so served its interests.

* Climate capitalism. You don’t need to stop flying, just buy offsets. You don’t need to use public transport, just buy an electric car. Capitalism always finds a way.

* So far on this trip I’ve taken photos exclusively using an iPhone 11 Pro but today I took my FujiFilm X100T out with me for the sake of comparison. Should have left the iPhone at home; no amount of software magic can beat the physical characteristics of a big piece of glass.

* Using a mobile phone, in a foreign country, on a train, and trying to pay my taxes before the self assessment deadline. Each payment option presents a challenge. My debit card has been frozen. My bank requires a card reader to set up a new payee. Setting up a direct debit will mean payment arriving after the deadline. Juggling multiple apps and webpages, copying and pasting reference numbers between screens. I’ve never felt so much like a canonical ‘mobile user’.

* The last four series of <cite>Cold Feet</cite> were a bit hit and miss, but while series 9 was one of the best, [now seems like a good time to pause][5]. I’m looking forward to seeing these characters again in their third age of live.

* Not sure what’s more concerning. Untold wealth acquired through tax-avoidance and slave labour, or the fact that so many stars from the <cite>Thick of It</cite> have visibly aged so much.

* Rummaging around in my email archives only to have a certain Mr. Benbow dispense some timely life advice from the beyond the grave. Cocky sod.

* They say the secret to good comedy is timing. Can confirm the same is also true of tragedy. And farce.

* The [toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol][6] feels like a hopeful and much needed sign that in 2020 society will be changed for the better.

* If [Vettel’s time at Ferrari][7] proved anything, it’s that while he’s a good driver, he’s by no means a great driver. If anything, he’s a good driver with a great deal of flaws.
