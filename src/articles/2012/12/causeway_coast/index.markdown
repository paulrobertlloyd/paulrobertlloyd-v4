After attending [Build][1] in Belfast last month, [Chris Armstrong][2] gave [Ethan Marcotte][3], [Chris Shifflet][4] and myself a tour of the Causeway Coast which, as the name suggests, is home to the famed [Giant’s Causeway][5]. Below is a selection of photos I took during our tour. [The full set can be viewed on Flickr][6].

In tandem with improving my proficiency with a camera, I’m trying to better understand [Aperture][7] and make more of my photos. These are the first I’ve processed using [VSCO film emulation filters][8]. The initial results are encouraging.

Besides showcasing some recent photography — something I’d like to do more often on this site — this is also an opportunity to experiment with the [compressive images][9] technique. The photos on this page have been saved with larger dimensions than required, but also lower quality levels than I would normally use. This should result in smaller file sizes and sharper imagery on high resolution displays. Daan Jobsis was the first to suggest this technique, and his [Retina Revolution][10] post is worth a read.
