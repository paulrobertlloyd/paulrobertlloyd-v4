7am
: I’m woken up early with an ambitiously set alarm. Quickly fall back to sleep.

8am
: Woken back up. Get mildly annoyed by breakfast radio, but continue listening as it eventually forces me out of bed.

9am
: After showering and cleaning my teeth, I weigh myself on my Wi-Fi scales. Fingers crossed for a low number!

10am
: Walking to work probably later than I should be. It’s a brief half-hour stroll, that often involves grabbing a flat white and breakfast bar from Moksha Caffè.

11am
: We do a daily stand-up meeting. Everybody in the office says what they did yesterday, what they plan on doing today, and if they have any blockers.

Noon
: Working on the latest project. Always enjoyable if this involves collaborating with my colleagues.

1pm
: With stomach rumbling, head to a local cafe. A popular choice right now is Toast of Brighton; their Lazy Morris fish-finger sandwich is one of my favourites at the moment.

2pm
: Working. One or two days a week I may go swimming with my colleagues, Andy and Josh.

3pm
: Still working. If I’m in a particularly generous mood, I may make a round of tea!

4pm
: By this point, Fireworks has probably crashed five times, and is now deciding whether to do so again. If I’m working with a client in America, then now is when I would have a catch-up meeting over Skype.

6pm
: Finishing off the day, perhaps posting a few messages for a client in Basecamp.

7pm
: Walk home, earphone in, listening to whatever is my favourite album of the moment. Right now it’s Coldplay’s Mylo Xyloto, but don’t hold that against me!

8pm
: If it’s Friday, I’ll be in the pub. Otherwise you’ll find me running at the local park, part of my preparation for next year’s Brighton Marathon — gulp!

9pm
: Maybe writing a blog post. Perhaps processing some holiday photos in Aperture. Even better, having dinner with friends. The personal stuff.

10pm
: Watching TV, catching up with RSS feeds, or replying to emails. If I’m not watching TV, perhaps watching a James Bond film instead. I’m currently going through the entire series, inspired by 5by5’s Talk Show podcast.

12am
: Thinking of going to bed, but probably catching up with friends in San Francisco over IM which continues for another hour or two.

2am
: Finally, bedtime. Wishing I had done so sooner.
