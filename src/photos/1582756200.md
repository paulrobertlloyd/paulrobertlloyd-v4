To celebrate @sammorrisdesignâ€™s [appearance in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/business/the-markup-tech-launch.html?searchResultPosition=1) this week, me, @mandr8, @c_p_pearson and @tobefrankj tried to recreate the iconic photo. Really captures the energy of the newsroom, I think.
