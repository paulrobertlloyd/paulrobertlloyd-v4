Facebook is trying to convince people that fake news is not their friend. And yet only yesterday, [Mark Zuckerberg admitted that Holocaust denial is permitted](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher#zpnLbz). [Child abuse gets a free pass](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-44859407) too. Facebook’s relationship with fake news isn't complicated; if it pays, it stays.
