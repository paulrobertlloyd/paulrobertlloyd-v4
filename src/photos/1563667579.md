One of my favourite photos from last month’s trip to Maastricht, taken from inside [one of the most incredible bookstores you’ll ever see](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/selexyz-dominicanen). Also, the first photo posted to my site using [IndieKit](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/).
