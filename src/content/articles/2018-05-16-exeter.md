Having only seen glimpses of Exeter from the train on previous trips down to Cornwall, this time I thought I’d stay in Devon’s capital for a short while and take a closer look. With its Roman walls and a medieval Guildhall, this city has [a curious mix of architecture][1], with its chief landmark being a [beautiful Norman Cathedral][2]. This was closed (for 3D scanning of all things), so I spent much of the day exploring its shopping precincts instead.

An abundance of post-war architecture gives this otherwise historic city the appearance of a new town like Crawley or Hemel Hempstead. I rightly assumed this was the result of German bombing, but as is so often the case, [what the Luftwaffe started][3], overzealous town planners finished. Exeter City Council [demolished much of the high street][4] between 1950 and 1980 with stretches of it now home to unsightly carbuncles such as an insipid brown brick-clad building currently occupied by Sports Direct and Tesco, and a Marks & Spencer whose frontage could easily have featured in the 1986 LEGO catalogue.

The area actually bombed during the Blitz was rebuilt as the Princesshay shopping district. A mix of limestone-coloured concrete and red brick, its multi-paned windows framed by protruding masonry, rounded awnings and embossed crests of former tenants give the area a coherent post-war — new Elizabethan? — feel. And yet, [Princesshay also fell victim to the bulldozer][5] when large parts of it were redeveloped in 2005 (somewhat successfully, I should add). For in Exeter [as is the case elsewhere][6], what goes up, must eventually, come down.
