One of my favourite comedians stars in a new show starting on Comedy Central this week. I first came across [Demetri Martin][1] as his role as a youth correspondent on [The Daily Show][2] — a segment in which he was also able to showcase his signature use of self-drawn illustrations, graphs and diagrams in his comedy.

This coming Wednesday he gets his very own show on Comedy Central: [Important Things with Demreti Martin][3]. Looking at the previews, I’m not sure whether his sketch comedy will hold up, but luckily the show contains some of his traditional stand-up too.

Sadly, to the best of my knowledge this show will only air in the US, but I’m hoping that the power of [Hulu][4] and a proxy server means I won’t miss out!
