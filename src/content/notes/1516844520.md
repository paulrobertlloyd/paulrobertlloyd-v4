[Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-write-a-blog-post/) on how to write:

> Randomly think of a thing. Let it bump around your head a bit. If the bumping gets too loud, start writing the words with the nearest writing device. See how far you get. The more words usually mean a higher degree of personal interest. Stop when it suits you.
>
> Wait for time to pass and see if the bumping sound returns. Reread what youâ€™ve written so far and find if it inspires you. Yes? Write as much as you can. No? Stop writing and wait for more bumping.

This perfectly articulates what I was [trying to get across in my last post](/2018/01/microblogging). This bumping sound can too often get drowned out by the sound of tweeting.
