Just seen [Ink](https://web.archive.org/web/20201024234943/http://www.inktheplay.com/) – a play about Rupert Murdoch and his purchase of <cite>The Sun</cite> – with his current wife sat just a few rows behind me. She’ll have approved, as Bertie Cavel depicts him in a remarkably good light. Less so the monsters he created.
