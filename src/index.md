Having worked with start-ups, design agencies and in-house teams, I now partner with public sector organisations to help them deliver purposeful digital products and services.

Equally adept at [interaction design][1] and [frontend development][2], I love to collaborate with multidisciplinary agile teams. I bring a critical eye to the design process, and advocate renewal over wholesale reinvention.

Honestly? I’m still trying to figure this stuff out. Maybe you are too. If so, [let’s talk][3].
