summary: The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people get started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Brighton for two days of brainstorming, working, teaching, and helping. Join us in Brighton and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and -- maybe more importantly -- encourage users to own their own content and identities.
