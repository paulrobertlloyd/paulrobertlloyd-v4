> Incorporating elements from their highly successful Edinburgh show and world-renowned YouTube videos, Brett and Steven will be joined by comedy sketch duo, Cardinal Burns (fresh from their critically acclaimed E4 series); and some very special surprise guests from Youtube.
>
> In a festive twist, the structure of the evening will be decided entirely by the audience via a giant advent calendar on stage.
>
> Expect music, comedy, and lots of surprises - all delivered with the deadpan panache of two men who still live with their mums.
