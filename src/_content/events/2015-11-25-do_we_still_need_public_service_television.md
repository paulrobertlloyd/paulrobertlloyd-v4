> Join us for the launch of a new inquiry chaired by Lord Puttnam, examining the future of public service TV. The Guardian’s head of media Jane Martinson and Lord Puttnam talk to broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, President of RTS Peter Bazalgette, Channel 4’s Jay Hunt and Maker Studio’s Luke Hyams as they debate whether we still need a public service TV system in the era of multi-channel abundance and if so, how best to secure it.
