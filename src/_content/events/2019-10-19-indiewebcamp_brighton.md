> IndieWebCamp Brighton is an all-levels BarCamp-like collaboration in Brighton, England for two days of keynotes, brainstorming, creating, teaching, and helping gain more control over our data and lives online!
>
> Learn how to use open web services, software, and technologies to empower yourself and – maybe more importantly – encourage all users to own their own content and identities.
>
> Bring your laptop and mobile devices, we’ll help you get setup to both publish where you want, and keep control of your content!
