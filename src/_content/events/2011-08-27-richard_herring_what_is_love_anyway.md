> Comedian Richard Herring returns to Edinburgh for his 20th Fringe and 32nd show. Having sorted out religion (<cite>Christ on a Bike</cite>), politics (<cite>Hitler Moustache</cite>) and penises (<cite>Talking Cock</cite>), the star of award winning podcast <cite>As It Occurs To Me</cite> and Radio 4’s <cite>Richard Herring’s Objective</cite> seeks to define and destroy love. Before love destroys him. Again.
