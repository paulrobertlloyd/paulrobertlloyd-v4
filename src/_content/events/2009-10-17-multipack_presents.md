> For our fourth Presents event weâ€™ve got presentations on the state of play with Rich Internet Applications, from Microsoft Silverlight (Nick Harewood) and HTML 5 (Bruce Lawson). As always meet beforehand at the Old Crown in Digbeth for lunch and a pint, before heading to the offices of One Black Bear for the presentations.
