Walking west along Princes Street, I make my way through the throng of festival goers and find myself drawn to the sun drenched Old Town and the cragged rock upon which the castle sits. A squeal of train brakes emanates up from where once was -- and seemingly could still be -- a loch. There are few places quite as architecturally, topographically and culturally rich as Edinburgh. I love this city.
