Based on @tobefrankjâ€™s glowing recommendation, went to see <cite>[Us](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6857112/)</cite> this evening. Proper good horror fodder, aspects of which brought to mind episodes of <cite>Inside No. 9</cite> and <cite>The Shining</cite>, which can be no bad thing. Great soundtrack, too.
