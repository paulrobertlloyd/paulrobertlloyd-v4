Watched <cite>[After Life](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8398600/)</cite> fully expecting to hate it but, aside from its chocolate-box depiction of England and overly saccharine moments, think it may be Gervais’ finest work since <cite>The Office</cite>. As vehicles for his opinions go, it’s surprisingly thoughtful and delightful.
