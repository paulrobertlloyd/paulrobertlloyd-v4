Always difficult to compare new stuff with the old and familiar, but having watched the first episode of [This Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002v3d) twice now and laughed throughout both viewings, I think it’s safe to say Alan’s back! Incompetent and insecure, out classed and out of touch. Ah-ha!
