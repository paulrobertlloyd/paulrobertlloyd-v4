    Hey Jon! I’m currently using a [Canon Powershot G9](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canong9/) — a camera that falls somewhere between high-end compact and low-end DSLR. This means it’s small enough to be able to fit in my trouser pocket (just), but at the expense of some features available in full SLRs (interchangeable lenses, better image sensors etc.)

    Considering I brought a tripod for use on this trip (an excellent investment in and of itself), and thus carried camera equipment around in my bag, I’m considering upgrading to a larger EOS range camera – but this is a big and expensive leap!

    Nice re-design! Simple, elegant and not all shoved over to the left!

    When are we going to see see your review of 2008 post?

    Nice – I’ll need to consider the G9 at some point. Ain’t cheap though.
