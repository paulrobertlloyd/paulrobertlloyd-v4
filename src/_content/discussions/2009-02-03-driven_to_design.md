    My friend, I’m loving these shorter, one a day blog posts. They’re a joy to read, rather than loosing interest half way through simply because of the sheer length of the thing.

    By the way, if you’d like to tidy my room when you return, I’ll leave it as a little treat for you.

    I think what got me into it is my urge to not just be better myself, but make everything around me better. I call myself an interaction designer these days, but grew up thinking about being a Web or graphic designer. I’ve found interaction designer to be much more appropriate in that I love it when I just hit if off with a website, product, or service.

    Interacting with things can be so easy, so enjoyable – or it can be a downright nightmare. It’s my passion to make (design) and use things that put a smile on my face every time I use them.

    (Also, as a little background, I grew up building PCs before creating themes and icons for Windows XP. That eventually led me to Photoshop and GeoCities… the rest is history).
