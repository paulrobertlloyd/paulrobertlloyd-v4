    Enjoy your holiday. Sounds like it will be fantastic.

    I really want to get further away from the UK than Spain, so far I am yet to manage it. Hoping that the saving that I have been doing means by this time next year I would of made it past that barrier I havenâ€™t crossed yet.

    Have a great time.

    Andy.
