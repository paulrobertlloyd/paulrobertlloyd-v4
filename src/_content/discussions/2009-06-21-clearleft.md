    Nice post Paul, it's great to see what has taken you to Clearleft. So we are both kinda new to the office then? :)

    Great Paul! Good luck working with Clearleft. I like Clearleft site a lot and since past few months have been following it a bit, I think they are experts.

    (P.S.: i applied for a job but i guess am not suitable so did not get a reply, but thats ok :)

    I really like your site/style. Trying to do the same. Did you make your site theme yourself?
