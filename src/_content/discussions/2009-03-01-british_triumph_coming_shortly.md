    Damn, this is kind of… encouraging :). I’m plenty out of shape, but I am quite competitive :D. I might have to get on board with this Nike+ thing finally. I had the shoes about a year ago, but never took the ~$200 plunge to getting a Nano and Nike+ sensor.

    Kind of a big entry barrier, no?

    I’ve just read that I should be running 40 miles per week if I want to do a sub 20min 5K. Come on Mr. Lloyd, how about a challenge of that nature next month?
