    I’ve got a similar setup, naming all my Apple gear… except mine are named after elderly women.

    * MBP: Blanche
    * 30" Cinema Display: Estelle
    * iPhone: Maude
    * iPod: Edith
    * External HD1: Rosemary
    * External HD2: Agnes

    Helps me make my workspace my own… everyone knows their names around the office, too :).

    This is a great idea. Unfortunately I’ve no specific naming conventions with the exception of my external hard drives which I named after cartoon characters (Zim and GIR). I might stretch the cartoon naming convention out to my iPhone and other devices but I might try and find something a little more interesting :)

    Never named any Apple stuff anything different from the normal “Andrew Yates’ X”. Sounds a pretty cool idea, I like the HMS Discovery idea alot.

    I wondered what I could use to name all of my Apple gear.

    Its a mix between the Jay & Silent Bob and Monkey Island characters for me.

    Our home network is the 100 Acre Wood, with the various devices being named after the characters who inhabit it.
