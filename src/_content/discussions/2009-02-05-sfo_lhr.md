    How long of a plane trip is that? I can hardly stand going back to from California to Wisconsin (4 hrs direct, 6 hrs with layover).

    Usually somewhere between 10 and a half to 11 hours (depending on tail winds etc.) for direct flights. I’m always a bit shocked by this figure, given I usually get it confused with the time difference, which is 8 hours!
