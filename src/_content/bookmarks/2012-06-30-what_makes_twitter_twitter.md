Adrian Short:

> I view the latest announcement from Twitter to independent developers with a suspicion bordering on contempt. [Delivering a consistent Twitter experience][1] is a comprehensive rejection of everything that Twitter has stood for and that has made Twitter great.

Twitter’s original decision to scale the business before working out how it would make money seems to be backfiring. It turns out all the things that make Twitter a great product, fly in the face of what’s needed to generate revenue. This is especially true given its [pursuit of an ad-supported business model][2] – a strange choice when many would [happily pay][3] to use it.

I’ve always felt the idea behind Twitter would have been more successful in the long term if it had been designed more like a protocol rather than a product. By taking the route it did, it’s destined to become another service on the web that will ultimately fade into obscurity.

Twitter could have been the new email. Instead it’s likely to become the next Myspace.
