Garrett Murray perfectly sums up my thoughts on the changes to Gowalla:

> This version steps away from the straight-forward check-in functionality and replaces it with a more social version called "stories" The basic idea is that you create a story at a location, tag your friends, upload photos and comment. I think this is a terrific idea, and I think it's something relatively unique in the check-in app space.

I'm willing to keep the app on my iPhone for a little while, if only in the hope that the new city guides will prove useful during my forthcoming trip to the US and Canada. Still, it's hard to see myself using this application much more than I used to, if at all.
