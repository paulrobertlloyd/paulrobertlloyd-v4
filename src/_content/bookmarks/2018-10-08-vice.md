From the director of <cite>Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy</cite> and <cite>The Big Short</cite>, Adam McKay’s latest promises to be both entertaining and informative. Christian Bale is once again unrecognisable as the film’s protagonist, but the supporting cast looks incredible as well. I’m looking forward to this one.
