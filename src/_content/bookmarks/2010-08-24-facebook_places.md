Garrett Murray:

> It’s not that Facebook’s Places feature is bad, it’s just that it’s boring. It’s nothing special. They didn’t do it better than anyone else.
>
> That’s the problem with Facebook. They are slowly destroying independent web applications with boring versions that immediately win due to Facebook’s population. There’s no demand for excellence.
