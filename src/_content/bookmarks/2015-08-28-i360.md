Leo Benedictus writes about Brighton’s new “vertical pier” in the Guardian:

> About once a century, Brighton builds something mad. Between 1786 and 1823, [it was the Royal Pavilion][1], an Asian fusion fantasy fun palace where the Prince Regent could eat, drink, gamble and fornicate more ostentatiously than would be polite in London. Between 1866 and 1916, with mass pleasure-seeking now enabled by the railways, it was [the West Pier][2], the great masterpiece of the architect Eugenius Birch, featuring a pavilion (later a theatre) and eventually a concert hall. Next summer, right on time, it will be something new. Most of Britain doesn’t know about it yet, but pretty soon it will be one of the country’s most famous buildings.

My friend [James][3] referred to [the i360][4] as a “self–indulgent, grossly–oversized phallus complete with champagne bar cock–ring”. I’m reserving judgement.
