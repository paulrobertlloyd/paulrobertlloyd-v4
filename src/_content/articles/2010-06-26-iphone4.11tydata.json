    "content": "I agree. I have a 3GS, so I will get more out of iOS4 compared to the 3G, but although I would like to upgrade I realise – exactly like you said – my current phone is such a massive leap from my previous (and the fact I waited until the third generation) means I can let the new iteration pass me by. I am not interested in FaceTime, but the retina display and speed boost will be impressive when I finally upgrade. All the other features are software based – and I get.\n\nWritten on my iPhone."

    "content": "Having gone from an iPhone 3G to the 4, I’ve gotta say how much of an improvement it is. The camera for one thing is incredible – I never used my 3G camera as the quality just wasn’t high enough but the 4 has negated any need for me to buy a digital camera. The retina display is also very impressive, but I could have lived without it.\n\nThe most important thing for me though is the speed – I got so irritated by my 3G over the past few months as I could barely use some apps before it locked up and restarted. I haven’t been able to induce any slow-down on the 4, it really is very impressive. Another big reason for me to upgrade was the battery life – where my 3G would die after 3/4 of a day under heavy usage, the 4 will last two days.\n\nPersonally, upgrading from the 3G to 4 was a must. I’d definitely have thought twice had I previously upgraded to the 3GS, but the level of improvement from the 3G is seriously impressive."

    "content": "Agree 100%. In the brief time that I’ve had a play with an iPhone 4 (having already updated my 3GS to iOS4), any thoughts of upgrading early were immediately eradicated. Once I got over the “oooh it’s shiny…” phase, it was little more than what I was carrying in my pocket.\n\nI’m a little envious of the 3G because it doesn’t support Multi-tasking. In my opition, it’s overrated. I’ve spent more time using it to close apps down completely than what it was designed to do. To me it’s nothing more than a power-chowing pain which you seemingly can’t disable with jail-breaking the phone."

    "content": "I upgraded to iOS4 on my 3G and it became practically unusable it was so slow. So if you’ve not gone iOS4, don’t. If you have, i recommend you downgrade to 3 again as it really is much faster.\n\nOn the other hand, if you can go iPhone 4, do, you will seriously wonder how you ever managed with your 3G, they are worlds apart. After initial concern about signing a new long-term contract to get the thing, i’m very pleased i did. I’ve had no reception issues (well no worse than before!) and it’s made using the device a pleasure again…"
