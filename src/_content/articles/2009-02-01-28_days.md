Over the last few years I have built up a quite a number of half-written blog posts; some in the form of bulleted lists, others in retrospect not that far from completion, yet somehow none of them got published. With the transition to this new blog I have managed to increase the frequency of my posting a little (especially when compared to the [drought of last year][1]) yet writing still doesn't feel habitual when I it needs to be for my blog to reach its full potential.

So here's the plan. For the month of February I intend to publish a post a day -- note that I'm choosing the month with the least number of days to attempt this! My hope is that this exercise will help me become a more efficient blogger and encourage me to publish thoughts and ideas that may otherwise languish in the unpublished pile. It's a tall order -- wish me luck!

**Update:** See the monthly archive for [a list of posts written so far][2].
