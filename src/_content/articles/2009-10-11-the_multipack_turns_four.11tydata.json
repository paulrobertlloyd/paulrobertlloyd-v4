    "content": "I remember my first Multipack meeting back in April 2006. It’s great that some of the people I met then are still attending regularly and, like me, finding it rewarding.\n\nI also attended @media 2005, but such was the professional isolation I felt then, that it took almost a year before I found the Multipack.\n\nThese days, as you point out, there is a glut of events and groups for Web geeks to attend and participate in, which is a very positive state of affairs. And I’m glad that Multipack continues to go from strength to strength, particularly Geek In The Park.\n\nBy the way, watch your spelling of ‘fourth’ ;)"
