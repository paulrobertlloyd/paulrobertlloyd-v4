    "content": "Good point! I realise this post didn’t really provide much of a review. I think in terms of marks out of ten, I’d give it an easy eight, perhaps a nine.\n\nFor a full 10/10, I like a film that has me thinking about the outcome or plot points for a number of hours after the final credits role, which I didn’t feel the need to do after watching this film. However, I was engaged throughout, at no point lost interest, and even though I had a good idea of the films outcome, the story never felt predictable – always a good sign.\n\nAs you told me, it’s definitely a film worth seeing; the cinematography is breath taking, the soundtrack enjoyable, and although some of the acting is a bit suspect in places I would happily watch the film again. I’m also interested in watching some of Danny Boyle’s previous films now too."

Then there is 28 Days Later and The Beach, all widely different movies.\n\nI agree totally with your final sentance review. And your score. My initial thoughts were (as you put it, an easy) eight of ten, but after thinking more closely I changed to a nine. I would like to see it again in the cinema… hopefully."
