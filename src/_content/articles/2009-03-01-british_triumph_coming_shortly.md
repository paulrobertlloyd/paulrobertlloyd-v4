Americans are quite a competitive race, an admirable trait given the countless wars they've lost and their inability to build a desirable automobile. In fact, I'm inclined to believe the only American success is to be found at the all-you-can-eat buffet.

History may have told a different story had their pesky ancestors just paid their taxes instead of getting into a tizzy and declaring independence from us British.

Sadly, I have yet to convince my friend [Kyle][1], who believes 1776 was his country's finest hour. I should mention that Kyle lives in [Los Angeles][2], a city built on top of the [San Andreas Fault][3]. Just incredible.

If common sense and the passage of history aren't enough to prove that the [Treaty of Paris][4] was a colossal error on the part of our colonial cousins, then [a challenge][5] via the Nike+ website will have to demonstrate British superiority instead.

The challenge: who can run the most miles over the course of March. You can <del datetime="2014-05-28T02:32:00">follow its progress with the widget on the right, and</del> provide encouragement in the comments below. Bring it!
