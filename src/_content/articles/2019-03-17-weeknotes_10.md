Sat in a planning session for a project I was briefly pulled onto, I thought to myself “this is *fascinating*”. This thought was so clear, that for a moment I wondered if I had said it out loud. I’ll maintain a degree of professionalism and not say much more, but it was interesting to see what happens when a prominent project is felt to be going awry. Anyway, my second week in government was *very* different to my first, yet my understanding of how things work in Whitehall is a good deal clearer as a result — although I suspect I’ve barely scratched the surface.

Such unpredictability may soon become tiring, but for now, I’m rolling with the punches and trying to absorb and learn as much as I can. After my break away from the world of design, it also feels good to be exercising my creative muscles again. This enthusiasm was evident when I grabbed a drink with [Rob][1] on Wednesday night at the new [Holler Taproom][2], which has been on my to-visit list since it opened a few months ago. Their [Acidulated House][3] beer hit the spot, but Rob thinks the place smells like bleach. You can’t please everyone.

Today is my Dad’s birthday, so yesterday me and my parents visited the [Clergy House in Alfriston][4], the first building acquired by the National Trust. One of the features of its timber frame is a carved oak leaf, which may have been the inspiration for the trust’s familiar logo. [Alfriston][5] is one of those quintessential Sussex villages untouched by history, yet undoubtedly swamped by tourists and ramblers throughout much of the year. I may join them when the weather improves.
