    "content": "Thanks for the positive feedback (although I’m not quite sure about the Womble reference, Angie!).\n\nThe logo was re-designed in 2004 by our in-house Print & Design team. This was to make the logo less busy and more accessable to people.\n\nIt’s black and white to minimise reproduction costs although the Mayor’s Office is entitled to use a version that has a colour crest.\n\nIt was very much a conscious decision to rebrand as ‘Walsall Council’ rather than the legally accurate but its-a-mouthful-to-say-it ‘Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council.’\n\nLegally, we remain Walsall MBC but there was a drive to refer to ourselves as Walsall Council across all media. It’s simpler. It is, afterall, also what residents refer to us as.\n\nI’m told that the designer responsible in Kevin Williams team was one Steve Bagley.\n\nDan Slee\nWalsall Council press office\nTwitter: @walsallcouncil"
