    "content": "I’m so glad the BBC are pushing the boundaries and not settling for the improvements they’ve already made.\n\nI’ve always felt the existing style of the header and navigation looked quite amateur and wasted space for the sake of a rather ugly gradient. The improved navigation will hopefully encourage people to hang around and explore more   content:  than they likely do at the moment.\n\nGreat post, and WOOHOO looks like IKEA are hogging all the Verdana these days :D"

    "content": "There is no doubt that the work coming out of this project is to a high standard and the method of sharing ‘work in progress’ will certainly help the rollout and cushion the user’s transition.\n\nHowever the aspect of this work that I find really exciting is how a relatively small team has managed to motivate and launch this project. Selling the need for good design in to an organisation, as large as the Beeb is a massive achievement in itself. To win the necessary support and budget to deliver this project must have taken the plight of UX Design through to the top ranks. So I’d like to extend my congratulations to the team involved in getting it off the ground and to the execs who backed it."
