As [one of the nominees][1] for Designer of the Year in the 2014 net Awards, Creative Bloq chatted to me to find out more.

***

**Creative Bloq:** Give us a summary of your career so far.

**Paul Lloyd:** I’ve been working in the industry for almost a decade. I started out at a small design agency, but freelancing in my spare time saw a move to California in 2006 to work for [Ning][2], a small technology start-up founded just as the sector was emerging from the dot-com bubble. Finding that whole scene a bit weird, I returned to the UK, and soon after joined [Clearleft][3], where I spent five enjoyable years working with clients like Mozilla, NBCUniversal, Channel 4 while also responsible for the design of [Fontdeck][4]. This last November, I moved to [the Guardian][5].

***

**CB:** What have you been working on over the last year?

**PL:** At the start of last year I was working on a (still to be launched) mobile-first [responsive redesign for UNICEF UK][6], and then an intranet for the Francis Crick Institute — both projects frustratingly not accessible to the public. My favourite work from last year was the redesign of [24 ways][7], and [the beginnings of a personal project][8]: the digital restoration of [Bradshaw’s victorian railway guide][9].

***

**CB:** What have been the particular high points of your career?

**PL:** Having wrote [an article for A List Apart][10] in 2012 (definitely a highlight!) last year I ‘took to the road’ to [talk about web native design][11]. I used early television design as an example of how we should understand the nature of the mediums we design for, and embrace their unique characteristics. Jeremy kindly asked me to speak about this at [Responsive Day Out][12], and while speaking in front of 400 people was entirely stressful, I really enjoyed sharing my thinking with a wider audience.

***

**CB:** Who and what influences and inspires your work?

**PL:** While I’ve made web design my profession, I’m really interested in brand identity and design for television. Perhaps it’s no surprise then that [Saul Bass][13] is one of my favourite designers. His work remains timeless, and although working on the web often prohibits longevity, it’s something I strive for in all my work.

***

**CB:** What are you excited about at the moment?

**PL:** I try to straddle the worlds of both design and front-end development, so I’ve been looking at tools like Grunt, LESS and Sass. In a long-overdue redesign for my personal site, I’m looking to use Jekyll, which is opening my eyes to languages like Ruby and server software like nginx, too.

***

**CB:** Tell us about an important lesson you’ve learned in your career.

**PL:** If you don’t understand something, don’t be afraid to ask for help. Be that when trying to understand the needs of a client, or when learning how a particular technology works. Also, the sooner you ask, the better!

***

**CB:** Name an ‘unsung hero’, someone you admire who deserves recognition for their work.

**PL:** I would have suggested James Bates, had he not been nominated! I’m also a huge fan of fellow Brighton based designer, [Bevan Stephens][14]. Formerly an intern at Clearleft, he designed the sensational websites for [Ampersand 2012][15] and [dConstruct 2012][16].
