Demoed using Silicon Valley’s favourite first-world problem — booking a table at a restaurant in San Francisco — [Google Duplex](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html) instead opens a can of worms. [I agree with Ethan](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/kumiho/):

> I think we’re well past the point where our industry gets a pass for launching products without thinking about their second-order effects.

A related anecdote. Having received far too many robocalls asking if I had been involved in a car accident recently, I took to making beeping noises down the phone to see how far I could progress through these annoying and false conversations. One day I almost — *almost* — started to do this before realising a real person was calling about a genuine issue. Had I made those funny noises, not only would I have been deeply embarrassed, it would have been pretty demeaning for the person on the other end of the line.

In a society where truth and trust are a scarce resource, this appears to be an incredibly foolish product to be bringing into the world. Talking of trust; I have zero faith Google will do the right thing with this technology, rhetoric about transparency or not.
