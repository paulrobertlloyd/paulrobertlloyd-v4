    "content": "Great to read about your reflections on what was indeed a superb summer. My Dad was a Games Maker too (first aid) and I managed to get to a few events, mostly at the Paralympics.\n\nI’d just like to say the Last Mile volunteers made the experience fantastic. The energy and good vibe you all gave off before we entered the stadium was brilliant. And my 4 year old loved high-fiving as many games makers as he could meet.\n\nIt’s great to have such an incredibly positive event in Britain, proves we don’t have to be a grumpy weather-obsessed nation all the time!"
