    "content": "Wow, that’s pretty cool, Paul! Having small “conventions” like this a is great way to keep up on industry trends and build a more collaborative team of qualified professionals.\n\nWe took our first steps to a similar idea here in Campbell, CA – it’s called the ZURBsoapbox, an open discussion about a topic. Love ideas like these; reminds me of other movements like the Refresh events and even larger conferences.\n\nBest of luck!"
