    Great work again my friend, but after reading this post I’m left wondering if you’ve recently swallowed a thesaurus?

    Beautiful work, as always. Plus, the title made me laugh.

    I wonder if you are accepting suggestions for new icons for an updated set. For example: Spotify, Grooveshark, Pandora, Metacafe, Cuil (a serious competitor for Google and Yahoo), Amazon etc.

    This icon set is great, and I totally understand your rationale. Thank you for putting this out there, I really appreciate it.

    I wonder if MeetUp and/or SoundCloud might meet your criteria for inclusion now? I’m also a libre.fm user, but I’m aware that there are not too many of us.

    Anyway, thanks again!

    I wholeheartedly agree with you about catering to the 80%… Most sets come with icons for services I have never heard about, knowing that I spend 12 hours a day online and I am by no mean an average internet user…. Nice set overall, I was about to start my own if  google hadn’t led me here :)
