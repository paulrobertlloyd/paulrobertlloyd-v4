I watched _Licorice Pizza_ at the cinema twice (and then had HAIM on repeat for the rest of the year). Such a funny and uplifting movie; _The Guardian_ has it as [number 5 for its best films of 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/dec/19/best-films-of-2022-in-the-uk-no-5-licorice-pizza), but it’s my favourite film of the year.
