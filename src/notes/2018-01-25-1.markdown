[Michael Lopp](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-write-a-blog-post/) on how to write:

> Randomly think of a thing. Let it bump around your head a bit. If the bumping gets too loud, start writing the words with the nearest writing device. See how far you get. The more words usually mean a higher degree of personal interest. Stop when it suits you.
>
> Wait for time to pass and see if the bumping sound returns. Reread what you’ve written so far and find if it inspires you. Yes? Write as much as you can. No? Stop writing and wait for more bumping.

This perfectly articulates what I was [trying to get across in my last post](/2018/023/a1/microblogging/). This bumping sound can too often get drowned out by the sound of tweeting.
