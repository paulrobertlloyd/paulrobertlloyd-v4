[Emil Nolde’s colourful expressionist work](https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/emil-nolde-colour-life) appeals to my aesthetic sensibilities. Yet his anti-Semitic views and support for the Nazis (who deemed his art to be degenerative) make him hard to admire. It’s that age old quandary; can you separate art from the artist?
