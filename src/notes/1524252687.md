The Birmingham Design Festival is shaping up to be a great event. The [Renew/Rebuild](https://birminghamdesignfestival.org.uk/event/renew-rebuild/) discussion is of particular interest; especially relevant when many of Birmingham’s brutalist buildings have been demolished in recent years. Such a shame I’ll be on holiday when it’s on.
