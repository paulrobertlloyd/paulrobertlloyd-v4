Travels between Germany and Denmark have seen me spend an inordinate amount of time on DSB’s [IC3/IR4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC3), a train that combines the comfort of British Rail’s Class 442 Wessex Electrics with the aesthetic of <cite>Star Trek</cite> and the absurdity of Terry Gilliam’s <cite>Brazil</cite>.
