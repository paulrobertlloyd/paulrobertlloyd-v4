I’m a huge fan of <cite>[Inside No. 9](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2674806/)</cite>, but just watched the live episode on iPlayer and feeling underwhelmed. It all seemed a bit obvious, with the story spoon fed to the audience and relying too heavily on pre-recorded material. Maybe it worked better on the night?
