Finally watched [The Trip to Spain](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6193424/) on my flight over to São Paulo. Having already seen the first few episodes I thought this instalment lacked charm of the first two. Watching this feature-long edit only cemented those concerns.

This series has clearly run out of ideas, as evidenced by the weirdly drawn out conclusion. You should always leave the table a little hungry; I’m full.
