Having seen the first episode of [Mark Kermode’s Secrets of Cinema](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bbn5x8) in which Kermode deconstructs the romcom, finally sat down to watch the modern archetype of the genre, [When Harry Met Sally](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098635/). Think I’ll do the same with the other episodes in this series, too.
