Am reminded of Jon Stewart’s view that the conflict is [not left versus right](https://ew.com/article/2010/11/11/jon-stewart-on-the-rachel-maddow-show-we-have-a-special-place-in-our-hearts-for-fox/) but corruption versus not-corruption; ‘[contrarian narcissists who trade as “free-thinkers”](https://unherd.com/2022/03/why-the-left-is-split-over-ukraine/)’ sit firmly in the first camp.
