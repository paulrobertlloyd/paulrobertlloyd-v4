Currently watching series two of <cite>The Crown</cite>. Claire Foy’s impersonation of the Queen is impeccable, matched only by Bertie Carvel’s embodiment of Robin Day. Both are genuinely believable – unlike HMY Britannia, whose CGI reminds me of that used in <cite>Titanic</cite>, twenty years ago.
