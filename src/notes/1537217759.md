I rarely have anything good to say about Uber, but thanks to this [uncharacteristically restrained work from Wolff Olins](https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_uber_by_wolff_olins_and_in_house.php), I have to admit that I find their latest rebrand to be damn near perfect. Perhaps finally there are some adults in the room.
