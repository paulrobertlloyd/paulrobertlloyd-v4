Really enjoyed [Glass Onion](https://imdb.com/title/tt11564570/). Rian Johnson’s second whodunit – a well-timed indictment of supposed genius ‘disrupters’ – feels different to the first, almost winking at the audience throughout. Daniel Craig was clearly having a ball, but it’s Janelle Monáe who carries this film.
