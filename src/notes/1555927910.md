Watched [""After Life""](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8398600/) fully expecting to hate it but, aside from its chocolate-box depiction of England and overly saccharine moments, think it may be Gervais’ finest work since ""The Office"". As vehicles for his opinions go, it’s surprisingly thoughtful and delightful.
