The [University of Wales][1] is a confederal university responsible for accrediting degrees for institutions in Wales and more than 120 higher education institutions within the UK and in 30 further countries overseas.

Catering for more than 90,000 students worldwide, the university was looking to create a *global campus*, providing a far-reaching range on online services that would enable effective collaboration between staff, departments, institutions and students, both internally and externally.

Working with James Box at Clearleft, and facing a constrained budget and short engagement, we decided to create a highly modular design that would enable new pages and features to be created once our involvement was over. With a separate team responsible for building the content management system, I provided detailed guidance to ensure they could implement the design in a cohesive way, ensuring the overall experience remained consistent across the global campus, micro-sites and the myWales social e-learning network.
