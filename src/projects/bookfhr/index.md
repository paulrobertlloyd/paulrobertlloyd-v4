[BookFHR][1] provides discounts on airport hotels, parking, lounges and other travel services in the UK.

During a short engagement working alongside Richard Rutter at Clearleft, I helped improve the overall user experience, with particular focus on search and booking flows. I also provided a more consistent visual treatment for the site, and took the opportunity to refine the companyâ€™s logo.
