[Jonas Söderström][1] on how Google’s ‘People Analytics group’ goes to extreme lengths to work out how to improve workplace happiness, something Europeans figured out decades ago:

> In my view, the dream of “Big Data in the Workplace” thrives in that hole in the American corporate mind where more human ideas – such as [decent trade unions][2], a commitment to conversation and [dialogue between employees and management][3], and [empowerment of employees][4], even giving them some say over how their workplace is designed – should rightly be found.
