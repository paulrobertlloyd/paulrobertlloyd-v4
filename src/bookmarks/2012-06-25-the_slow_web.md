> Timely not real-time. Rhythm not random. Moderation not excess. Knowledge not information. These are a few of the many characteristics of the Slow Web. Itâ€™s not so much a checklist as a feeling, one of being at greater ease with the web-enabled products and services in our lives.

I like the sound of the Slow Web.
