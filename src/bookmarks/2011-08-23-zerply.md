Zerply is a professional network that helps you find like minded people by tags, skills, location and more. Essentially it’s a simpler, classier replacement for LinkedIn. It gained a degree of traction this week after being [featured by Tina Roth Eisenberg][1], who perfectly summed up my problems with LinkedIn:

> I had fallen out of love with [LinkedIn][2] a long time ago, but last week’s sneaky move (read about it [here][3]) pushed me over the edge. What a lost opportunity. LinkedIn was built on such a fantastic core idea. And then they tried to be twitter-and-facebook-and-everything-else at once. Bummer.

I’ve deleted my LinkedIn account. You can now find [my professional profile on Zerply][4].
