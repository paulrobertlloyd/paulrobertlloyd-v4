I’ve yet to see a full episode of ""The Late Show"" (which [I wrote about shortly after its debut][1]), but thanks to [clips posted online][2], I’ve still been able to get my regular Colbert fix.

One of my favourite aspects of the show is the opening titles, which feature shots taken from this extended version. Fernando Livschitz’s vivid tilt–shift photography pairs well with Jon Batiste & Stay Human’s signature tune, and showcases New York City to the extent that I now want to make a return visit.
