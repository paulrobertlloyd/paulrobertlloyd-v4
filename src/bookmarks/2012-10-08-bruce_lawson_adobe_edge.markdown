Bruce Lawson followed up on [my brief thoughts][1] with his own, having attended Adobe’s *Create The Web* event in London. As I suspected, some of the code produced by Edge Animate isn’t pretty, and there’s some weird messaging around browsers not based on WebKit. Yet he agrees that overall, this is the right strategy for Adobe.
