[Bret Victor][1] talks about why he is motivated to create creative tools, during his presentation at [CUSEC 2012][2]:

> Ideas are very precious to me, and when I see ideas dying, it hurts. I see a tragedy. To me it feels like a moral wrong, it feels like an injustice. And if I think there is anything I can do about it, I feel it’s my responsibility to do so. Not opportunity, but *responsibility*.

He also asks a good question; what’s the guiding principle behind everything you create?
